# DataVizProject


## Running the visualization

The visualization can be seen by visiting the following url: https://ahmedahres.github.io/templates/

Currently, the 2 level visualization only works for the country of Nigeria.

## Setting up Python Environment

The Python version which are using as part of the backend is Python 3.

To set up the appropriate Python environment, one would need to install the libraries with the right version.

You can do this using the requirements.txt file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the Python flask server, do the command: `python index.py` and that should open a localhost server.
